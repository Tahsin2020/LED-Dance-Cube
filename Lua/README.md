## NodeMCU Firmware ESP8266

<p>These lua scripts must be written to the board after its been successfully flashed with a nodemcu firmware generated at https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/release/build/. The init.lua is the primary script which triggers once the ESP8266 is powered, the credentials.lua file contains the hotspot's wifi credentials. Both of these should be written to the ESP 8266.</p>
